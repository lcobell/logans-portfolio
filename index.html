      Directions:
        1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content
        2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text
        3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer"
        4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line
        5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______")
        6. Make the word "favorite" italicized
        7. Make an image tag with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too!
        8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me"
        9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long!
        10. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects"
        11. Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3"
        12. Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text
        13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"
        14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
          - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded

      My name is Logan CoBell and I've been working in the restaurant industry since 2011.
      I began my restaurant journey in Charleston, SC working at the Market Pavilion Hotel's Roof Top Bar and Grill 225 as well as Charleston staples S.N.O.B.,
      The Charleston Grill, and Stars. 
      In 2015 I moved to St. Thomas, USVI and began my transition to bartending at the Cruzan Beach Club
      and later at the islands highest volume bar, Tap and Still
      where I was a manager and head bartender for two and a half years. 
      Upon moving back to the mainland during quarantine I was one of the opening bartenders at Orion's Roof 
      (recently named to Parade Magazine, Open Table, and Bumble's <a href="https://parade.com/1285156/kelli_acciardo/best-date-night-restaurants/">top 100 Date-Night Restaurants</a> in America for 2021) where I worked for 15 months,
      and was the longest tenured bartender.
      In December of 2021, I decided that I was ready to take the next step in my professional development and move to Chicago and pursue a position
      with Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises' <a href="https://www.rpmrestaurants.com/rpm-steak-chicago/">RPM Steak</a>, one of the top steakhouses in the country while also studying for a future in Software Development. 
      Ultimately I would like to use my experience in some of the countries finest restaurants and bars
      to design software applications to improve the restaurant industry. ❤️
